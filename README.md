//If you name the opposite classes in both of the windows ,yopu can haven them open instances of each other

//you can't declare anything in namespace except classes and interfaces

//when you subscribe you are attaching it to their channel

// Go ahead and Make a Class so the label will end up changing

//it will treat this as iff it was in the same class

//refactoring doesn't really change the functionallity it just makes it work more effeciently
